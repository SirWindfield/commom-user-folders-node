# common-user-folders-node

> A native node module for retrieving common user folder paths in a cross-platform matter.

Currently, the following folder paths are supported:

- Audio/Music
- Documents
- Desktop
- Pictures

The public API exposes methods to retrieve those folder paths:

- `audio_folder`
- `document_folder`
- `desktop_folder`
- `picture_folder`

<sub>The module is used in adventurer, a beautiful cross-platform `File Explorer` and `Finder` replacement with focus on file management</sub>
